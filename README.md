# Loch-Haven
Website for Loch Haven Retreat, Vacation Rental in N CA

The index.html/main.css were the saved files from each stage while I worked on index2.html/main.css...before I discovered Git, that is.

Started project using bootstrap, but I think I want to go a different direction. Also, font not showing up on some machines, so I'll be changing the large logo to a transparent gif.

I'll create the first branch for redoing the site from the beginning using responsive layout and working from the iPhone size up to iPad/Tablet, then desktop browser using breaking points.

First step, take out the bootstrap.
